<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <body> <h1>1. Introduction</h1><p>My name is Anna Kadurina and I am currently in my 6th semester at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. I am studying Software Advanced at this moment and I have background in Artificial Intelligence as well. Throughout this semester, I am going to prove my proficiency in several learning outcomes by completing an Individual and a Group project.</p><h1>2. Project Descriptions</h1><h2>2.1 Individual Project</h2><p>GetawayGo is a company focusing on providing a platform for travellers to find short-term accommodation worldwide. It will allow users to list, search and book properties while providing hosts with management tools. The goal of the project is to develop a scalable, user-friendly application for travellers and property owners. The aim is to create a platform thar will please the needs of both hosts and guests. The preferred situation is a fully functional application that connects travellers and hosts, providing both parties with a seamless experience for short-term stays. The advantages of this project are satisfying the travellersâ€™ needs, promoting tourism, and generating income for the owners of the properties. From an ICT point of view, the project offers a lot of possibilities, such as global scaling, user-centric designs and a lot of challenging functionalities such as external API integrations, AI integration, search features, filters, reviews and statistics.</p><h2>2.2 Group Project</h2><p>ReSoTo (Researchers Solutions Toolkit) is a software platform designed to provide researchers with a streamlined, flexible microservices architecture, making it easier to develop and manage research projects. By automating much of the technical setup through the use of XML and LEMMA scripts, it allows developers to focus more on project-specific features. The objective of this project is to enhance the ReSoTo platform, improving its usability and efficiency as a research support tool. The aim is to save developers time by letting them focus on subject-specific functionality rather than building research platforms. The updated system will include a web form, a modernized admin panel, and storage logic for handling multiple projects, delivering a reliable and efficient process for creating LEMMA scripts and managing research projects.</p><h1>3.
